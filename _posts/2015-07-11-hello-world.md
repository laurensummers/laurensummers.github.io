Thank you for visiting my blog. Want to know more about China? Me too!

Over the last few months, I've had the pleasure of experiencing the Chinese way of life. I visited China for the first time in December. I was travelling around with Chinese friends, so found myself immersed in the culture, traditional and emerging. The whole experience, from vast Beijing to little ancient towns, was fascinating, but there's so much more I want to explore.

The thing I love most about the culture that it revolves around food, something I wholeheartedly resonate with! China's strong heritage is embedded in the various cuisines throughout the country and the stories behind them are enchating.

Through this blog, I'll be reminiscing on the time I've spent in China and continuing to explore through the food though my Chinese friends, my own attempts at recreating some dishes, and hopefully sampling some real Chinese restaurants over here in the UK, a rarity.

I'd love you to join me!
