We're back home now and the girls and I had a lot to catch up on. Our girlie night in last night turned into a rather luxurious one with Joshy coming over and cooking for us! Joshy's Mongolian heritage means he's partial to rich, meaty food, and now we are too, the beef stew he made us was delicious! One thing I would have grimaced at on a menu was fermented tofu, but mixed in with a strong chilli oil the texture was pretty damn satisfying. It felt very fitting to be sharing our holiday stories over this lovely meal. Cheers, Joshy!
