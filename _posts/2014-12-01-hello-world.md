Thank you for visiting my blog. Want to know more about China? Me too!

Recently, I've had the pleasure of learning more about the Chinese way of life. I'm going to China for the first time in December travelling around with Chinese friends, immersing myself in the culture, traditional and emerging. I'm excited to explore!

The thing I love most about the culture that it revolves around food, something I wholeheartedly resonate with! China's strong heritage is embedded in the various cuisines throughout the country and the stories behind them are enchating.

Through this blog, I'll be talking about the time I spend in China and continuing to explore through the food though my Chinese friends, my own attempts at recreating some dishes, and hopefully sampling some real Chinese restaurants over here in the UK, a rarity.

I'd love you to join me!
