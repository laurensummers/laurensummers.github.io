A constant struggle for me has been trying to work out the difference between enjoying food and overeating. I find it virtually impossible to turn down food that is in front of me. I aspire to be one of those people who can keep half a  chocolate bar for later or leave a few chips on their plate when they’re done, but alas, they feel like another species. Buffets scare me - I turn into a monster.

The Chinese way of dining is all about sharesies. When we were in China, Joshy and Georgina would always order a vast array of dishes wherever we went, however hungry we were, and my natural (British?) instinct is to power through until it's all gone. But over the time we were away, being constantly exposed to this style, I got the chance to watch the relaxed pace of dining and tried to take this on board.

It wasn't always successful, many a meal I finished uncomfortably full, especially when hung over! But I did gradually become more accustomed to pacing myself and considering what I felt like eating - what my body wanted - rather than just finishing up my fair share. Plus it helped that the waiting staff weren't going to snatch it away from us when we were having a breather - in fact even in some of the most well regarded restaurants in Beijing we practically had to shout after the grumpy waiting staff to get the bill!

I suppose with meat and fish often being served on the bone, you have to take your time navigating the food rather than just shovelling it in. In one of the first restaurants we went to in China, Joshy ordered duck feet for me to try - throwing me in at the deep end! The meat (can you call a foot meat?!) was really tasty, kind of chewy and satisfying. However, I had to try hard not to be squeamish about the scaly texture of the talons....call me Western, but I think I’ll stick with a good old chicken breast next time!
